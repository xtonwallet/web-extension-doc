# Restore a wallet

You can restore your wallet or account by several ways. The most useful and secured is [keystore way](/ui/restore/restore_wallet_keystore). This file can be created by the backup procedure.

But also, if you are migrating from other wallet app, you can restore via [seed phrase](/ui/restore/restore_wallet_seed) and [keys](/ui/restore/restore_wallet_keys).
